                <P>Humans have lived in what is now Oman since at   least 106,000 years ago when Late Pleistocene people  left stone tools related to the Nubian Complex from  the Horn of Africa in the Dhofar region. This    indicates that humans moved from Africa into Arabia    around that time, if not earlier, possibly across the  Red Sea. </P>
                <P>The earliest known city in Oman is Dereaze, which    dates back at least 9,000 years. Archaeological finds  include flint tools, hearths, and hand-formed    pottery. A nearby mountainside also yields     pictographs of animals and hunters.</P>
                <P>Early Sumerian tablets call Oman "Magan," and note   that it was a source of copper. From the 6th century  BCE forward, Oman was usually controlled by the great    Persian dynasties based just across the Gulf in what   is now Iran. First it was the Achaemenids, who may    have established a local capital at Sohar; next the    Parthians; and finally the Sassanids, who ruled until  the rise of Islam in the 7th century CE.</P>
                <P>Oman was among the first places to convert to    Islam; the Prophet sent a missionary south around 630  CE, and the rulers of Oman submitted to the new  faith. This was prior to the Sunni/Shi'a split, so   Oman took up Ibadi Islam and has continued to     subscribe to this ancient sect within the faith.    Omani traders and sailors were among the most  important factors in propagating Islam around the rim    of the India Ocean, carrying the new religion to   India, Southeast Asia, and parts of the East African  coast. After the Prophet Mohammed's death, Oman came     under the rule of the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates,   the Qarmatians (931-34), the Buyids (967-1053), and   the Seljuks (1053-1154).</P>
                <P>When the Portuguese entered the Indian Ocean trade   and began to exert their power, they recognized   Muscat as a prime port. They would occupy the city    for almost 150 years, from 1507 to 1650. Their     control was not uncontested, however; the Ottoman   fleet captured the city from the Portuguese in 1552   and again from 1581 to 1588, only to lose it again    each time. In 1650, local tribesmen managed to drive   the Portuguese away for good; no other European   country managed to colonize the area, although the    British did exert some imperial influence in later     centuries.</P>
                <P>In 1698, the Imam of Oman invaded Zanzibar and   drove the Portuguese away from the island. He also    occupied parts of coastal northern Mozambique. Oman    used this toehold in East Africa as a market of    enslaved people, supplying African forced labor to     the Indian Ocean world. </P>
                <P>The founder of Oman's current ruling dynasty, the    Al Said took power in 1749. During a secession     struggle about 50 years later, the British were able    to extract concessions from an Al Said ruler in    return for supporting his claim to the throne. In  1913, Oman split into two countries, with religious  imams ruling the interior while the sultans continued    to rule in Muscat and the coast. </P>
                <P>This situation grew complicated in the 1950s when    likely-looking oil formations were discovered. The     sultan in Muscat was responsible for all dealings   with foreign powers, but the imams controlled the     areas that appeared to have oil. As a result, the   sultan and his allies captured the interior in 1959   after four years of fighting, once again uniting the  coast and interior of Oman.</P>
                <P>In 1970, the current sultan overthrew his father,    Sultan Said bin Taimur and introduced economic and     social reforms. He could not stem the uprisings     around the country, however, until Iran, Jordan,    Pakistan, and Britain intervened, bringing about a     peace settlement in 1975. Sultan Qaboos continued to    modernize the country. However, he faced protests in   2011 during the Arab Spring; after promising further  reforms, he cracked down on activists, fining and    jailing several of them.
