                My name is Carina F. Tallada. I was born in the Philippines and live with my family in Oman. I am
                currently studying Software Development through BYU Pathway Worldwide. I am happily married and have
                three wonderful children. I love to learn new things and I love to challenge myself to be better than I
                am now.
            </p>

            <p>The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is an archipelagic country in Southeast
                Asia. In the western Pacific Ocean, it consists of 7,641 islands, with a total area of roughly 300,000
                square kilometers, which are broadly categorized in three main geographical divisions from north to
                south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the
                Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the south. It shares maritime borders with Taiwan to
                the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia to
                the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. It is the world's twelfth-most-populous
                country, with diverse ethnicities and cultures. Manila is the country's capital, and its most populated
                city is Quezon City. Both are within Metro Manila.</p>
